## Quick Start
### Local Test Setup
First, we need to install a Python 3 virtual environment with:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv python_venv
```

You need to activate the virtual environment when you want to use it:
```
source python_venv/bin/activate
```
Please download all files:
- `main.py`file
- `requirements.txt` file
- `requirements2.txt` file
- `util.py` file
- `templates` folder


To fufil all the requirements for the python server, you need to run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
> Note: If this fails, please run `pip3 install -r requirements2.txt`

Because we are now inside a virtual environment. We do not need sudo.

Then you can start the server with:
```
python3 main.py
```
